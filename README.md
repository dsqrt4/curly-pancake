# Todo-App
A toy project to try some libraries I'm interested in.

This project uses these excellent projects:
- [***Poetry***](https://python-poetry.org/) - the simple tool for packaging and dependency management
- [***FastAPI***](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/) - the modern web-framework to create an HTTP based API
- [***Uvicorn***](https://www.uvicorn.org/) - the fast ASGI server to efficiently expose the API
- [***pugsql***](https://pugsql.org/) - the anti-ORM for simple database interactions
- [***yoyo***](https://ollycope.com/software/yoyo/) - the easy database migration tool
